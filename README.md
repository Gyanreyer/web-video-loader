# web-video-loader

A webpack loader for transcoding video assets into web-friendly formats which can be provided to a video's `<source>` tags to ensure each platform will load and play the smallest video file that it can support.

## Building the loader

`npm run build`

## Testing

In the `/example` directory, run `npx webpack build --mode=development`

## Remaining TODOs

- Final pass for cleanup/comments
- Unit tests!!!
